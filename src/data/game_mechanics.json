It is possible to fail when blessing the bowl causing the player to lose 5 prayer points in the process. If the blessed bowl is filled with the sacred pure water of the [[Kharazi Jungle|Kharazi]] water pool, it becomes a [[golden bowl]] containing sacred pure water that can be used with an [[enchanted vial]] to make a vial of [[holy water]]: one bowl can fill up to 10 vials. After making one successful golden bowl, the player can smith a gold bowl at any anvil, without need of the sketch, for 30 [[Smithing]] experience (though there remains a chance of failure); the bowl can then be taken to Gujuo to have it blessed.",

However, there are certain monsters that will never become [[tolerant]], such as [[Flesh Crawler]]s and [[Catablepon]].",

This stacks multiplicatively with the spell [[Shadow Veil]], where Shadow Veil will attempt to avoid the stun first for a total of 36.25% chance to not take damage from a failed pickpocket. As the player cannot fail a pickpocket attempt on a knocked out NPC, damage taken during [[Thieving training#Levels 45-55/91: Blackjacking|blackjacking]] can only be received by failing a knockout; as such, a dodgy necklace will have no effect on blackjacking.",

    "description": "Similar to a [[ring of recoil]], binding necklace charges are stored per player, not per necklace. Thus if the player sells or casts High Level Alchemy on a necklace with 1 charge remaining, the next necklace the player equips will still have only 1 charge. The player can right-click to \"destroy\" a binding necklace, destroying it and restoring the next binding necklace the player equips to 16 charges. This can be useful when a necklace drops to 1 charge left and a player is crafting runes in pairs, where a player can destroy a second necklace in their inventory and the equipped one will regain charges.",

However, in areas such as the [[Wilderness]], most monsters are indefinitely aggressive. As a rule of thumb, \"humanoids\" are not aggressive towards players except in some cases when the humanoid's nature or occupation has malign or criminal connotations (i.e. [[Black Knight]], [[Zombie]], [[Mugger]]). Most cities are also safe from aggressive monsters, though the perimeter or surroundings may not be as secure.",

The effect of the regen bracelet stacks with either the [[Rapid Heal]] [[prayer]] or with the [[Hitpoints cape]] (which do not stack with each other); using either of these in conjunction with a regen bracelet effectively quadruples the natural rate of Hitpoint regeneration, increasing it to 2 Hitpoints per 30 seconds. This is a very helpful perk during activities that deal low amounts of continuous damage, reducing the need to bank frequently and rely on outside sources of healing. Examples of activities where it is helpful are fighting weak but accurate [[Non-player character|NPCs]], subduing the [[Wintertodt]], fighting [[Zalcano]], doing [[Pyramid plunder]], or [[pickpocketing]] (though most players would prefer the added chance of double loot from wearing [[rogue gloves]] while pickpocketing).",

Using the remaining two doses of oil will then reward 10 more experience, since a vial containing 2 doses is being used. Because of this, when using full vials of oil, one can expect higher average amounts of experience per log than shown in this table.
