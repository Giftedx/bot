# Deprecated: Documentation Navigation Has Moved

This file is deprecated. Project documentation is now organized with MkDocs. Please use the navigation defined in `mkdocs.yml` and the files under the `docs/` directory.

Quick links:
- Home: `docs/index.md`
- Commands: `docs/commands/command-reference.md`
- Development Guide: `docs/development/development-guide.md`
- Deployment Guide: `docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md`
- Systems Overview: `docs/unified_systems.md`

If you need the old index, browse the `docs/` folder directly or use the generated site via `make docs-serve`.
