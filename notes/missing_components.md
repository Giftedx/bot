# Missing Components

This document lists the missing components identified in the project, based on the initial scan. These components are crucial for maintainability, security, and overall project health.

## Project Structure

- **Missing Package configuration (setup.py)**: The project lacks a standard `setup.py` file or an equivalent PEP 517/618 compliant `pyproject.toml` configuration. This makes it difficult to install the project as a package, manage dependencies, and define entry points.
