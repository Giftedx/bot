# Project Overview and Action Plan

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the media server project, its critical findings, and actionable steps for improvement.

## Executive Summary

The project is a media server with Discord bot integration, Plex media management, and virtual pet system.

-   **Total Python Files**: 99
-   **Total Lines of Code**: 8,153 (From Initial Scan - may have changed slightly as project evolves)
-   **Project Structure**:
    -   Core functionality resides within `src/`. This includes:
        -   `src/application.py`: Main application entry point.
        -   `src/bot.py`: Discord bot setup and core logic.
        -   `src/api/`: REST API endpoints.
        -   `src/config/`: Configuration management.
        -   `src/core/`: Core utilities and service managers.
        -   `src/pets/`: Pet management and potentially integration functionality (if related to task/reward system).
        -   `src/services/`: External service integrations (e.g., Plex).
        -   `src/ui/`: Placeholder for user interface components.
        -  `src/utils`: General utility functions.
    - There are test files in `tests/`, a task manager component, and security and documentation files.

## Initial Project Scan Results

The project scan (`scan.py`) has generated detailed reports in `bot_analysis.md` and `bot_analysis.json`. These reports contain:

- **Structure Report:** Analysis of the project's components, identifying any missing elements, security concerns, and suggested improvements.
- **Project Structure:** A breakdown of the project's directory structure, entry points, configuration files, environment variables, and other file types.
- **Dependency Analysis:** A list of project dependencies and their versions (this information will be in the JSON, and I should parse it from there).
- **Code Metrics:** Statistics on the codebase, including lines of code, complexity, and maintainability (this will also come from the JSON).
- **Documentation Coverage:** Evaluation of docstrings and overall documentation completeness.
- **Type Hint Coverage:** Assessment of type hint presence and completeness.

This information will be integrated into relevant sections of the notes.
