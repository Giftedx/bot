## Cross-System Integration Roadmap

This section tracks the ongoing effort to unify and integrate all major game systems (OSRS, Pokemon, and others) into a cohesive, maintainable architecture. The following roadmap outlines the key integration areas, priority tasks, and technical requirements for cross-system features.

### Integration Areas
- **Battle System**: Unified battle framework, turn system, damage calculations, status effects, animation, and command structure. Adapt for game-specific mechanics (OSRS combat, Pokemon types, special moves).
- **Pet System**: Common pet attributes, training, levels, cross-game interactions, inventory, and achievements. Support for OSRS boss/skilling pets and Pokemon as pets.
- **Achievement System**: Cross-game achievement tracking, shared rewards, universal points, leaderboards, and game-specific achievements.
- **Economy System**: Universal currency, currency conversion, cross-game trading, shared market, and game-specific economies (OSRS Grand Exchange, Pokemon marts).
- **Player Profiles**: Unified player data, cross-game stats, shared inventory, universal settings, and profile linking.
- **Social Systems**: Unified clans, cross-game activities, shared ranks, universal chat, and friend/trading systems.
- **Event System**: Unified event framework, cross-game events, shared rewards, scheduling, and game-specific events.
- **Reputation System**: Universal reputation, cross-game points, shared levels, rewards, and game-specific reputation (OSRS diaries, Pokemon badges).

### Priority Integration Tasks
1. Create unified player profile system
2. Implement shared battle framework
3. Develop universal pet system
4. Establish cross-game economy
5. Build unified achievement system
6. Create shared event framework
7. Implement universal reputation system
8. Develop cross-game social features
9. Create shared inventory system
10. Establish unified reward structure

### Technical & Data Migration Tasks
- Shared database schema
- Unified API endpoints
- Common authentication
- Shared caching and logging
- Cross-game messaging
- Unified test and backup systems
- Monitoring tools
- Documentation and integration guides
- Data migration for player data, achievements, pets, economy, social, events, reputation, and inventory

### Quality Assurance
- Test cross-game interactions and data consistency
- Balance economic and achievement systems
- Validate pet, social, event, and reputation features

### Future Enhancements
- Cross-game tournaments, seasonal events, cosmetics, ranking, questing, minigames, collection log, and player titles
