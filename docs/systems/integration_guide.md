# Cross-System Integration Guide

This guide tracks the technical tasks, priorities, and progress for integrating all major game systems (OSRS, Pokemon, and others) into a unified architecture. It is intended for developers and project managers coordinating cross-system work.

## Overview
- This document expands on the [Cross-System Integration Roadmap](./README.md) and provides technical details, migration steps, and QA requirements.
- For high-level priorities, see the Roadmap section in [README.md](./README.md).

## Technical Integration Tasks
- [ ] **Shared Database Schema**: Design and implement a schema supporting all core systems (battle, pets, achievements, economy, profiles, social, events, reputation).
- [ ] **Unified API Endpoints**: Expose consistent, versioned endpoints for all cross-system features.
- [ ] **Common Authentication**: Implement a unified authentication and authorization layer for all services.
- [ ] **Shared Caching System**: Centralize caching for performance and consistency.
- [ ] **Cross-Game Messaging**: Enable messaging and notifications across all integrated systems.
- [ ] **Unified Logging System**: Standardize logging for all services and features.
- [ ] **Common Test Framework**: Develop or adopt a test framework for integration and regression testing.
- [ ] **Shared Backup System**: Ensure all critical data is included in regular backups.
- [ ] **Monitoring Tools**: Deploy monitoring for system health, performance, and errors.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date API docs, integration guides, and user/admin documentation.

## Data Migration Tasks
- [ ] **Migrate Existing Player Data**: Map and transfer all player profiles to the new unified structure.
- [ ] **Convert Achievements**: Standardize and migrate achievement data.
- [ ] **Transfer Pet Information**: Migrate all pet data, including attributes and progress.
- [ ] **Update Economy Data**: Convert and merge currency, inventory, and transaction records.
- [ ] **Migrate Social Connections**: Transfer friends, clans, and other social links.
- [ ] **Convert Event Data**: Standardize and migrate event participation and rewards.
- [ ] **Update Reputation Information**: Migrate and unify reputation points and levels.
- [ ] **Transfer Inventory Data**: Migrate all inventory items to the new system.

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Test Cross-Game Interactions**: Ensure all integrated features work across games.
- [ ] **Verify Data Consistency**: Check for data integrity after migration.
- [ ] **Balance Economic Systems**: Test and adjust for fair, non-exploitable economies.
- [ ] **Test Achievement Tracking**: Ensure achievements are tracked and rewarded correctly.
- [ ] **Verify Pet System Functionality**: Test all pet-related features.
- [ ] **Test Social Features**: Validate friend, clan, and chat systems.
- [ ] **Validate Event System**: Ensure events are scheduled, run, and reward as intended.
- [ ] **Check Reputation Calculations**: Confirm reputation is awarded and displayed correctly.
