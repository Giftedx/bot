## Code Style Guide

### Python Code Style

1. Follow PEP 8
2. Use type hints
3. Write docstrings (Google style)
4. Keep functions focused and small
5. Use meaningful variable names

Example:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def process_media(media_id: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    """
    Process media and return its information.

    Args:
        media_id: The unique identifier of the media.

    Returns:
        dict: Media information or None if not found.

    Raises:
        MediaNotFoundError: If media_id is invalid.
    """
    try:
        return fetch_media_info(media_id)
    except MediaNotFoundError:
        logger.error(f"Media not found: {media_id}")
        return None
```

### JavaScript Code Style

1. Use ES6+ features
2. Use async/await
3. Follow ESLint configuration
4. Write JSDoc comments

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Fetch media information from the API.
 * @param {string} mediaId - The media identifier.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Media information.
 */
async function fetchMediaInfo(mediaId) {
    try {
        const response = await api.get(`/media/${mediaId}`);
        return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch media:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
```

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üíö `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

Example:
```
üé® Improve structure of media processing module

- Split media processing into smaller functions
- Add type hints
- Improve error handling
- Update documentation

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

1. Write unit tests for new features
2. Update existing tests when modifying features
3. Include integration tests when needed
4. Aim for high test coverage

Example:
```python
def test_media_processing():
    # Arrange
    media_id = "test_123"
    expected_title = "Test Media"
    
    # Act
    result = process_media(media_id)
    
    # Assert
    assert result is not None
    assert result["title"] == expected_title
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_media.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## Documentation

### Writing Documentation

1. Update README.md if needed
2. Update API documentation
3. Add examples for new features
4. Include docstrings in code

Example:
```markdown
## Media Processing

The `process_media` function handles media information retrieval:

```python
result = process_media("media_123")
print(result["title"])
```

### Generating Documentation

```bash
# Generate API documentation
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build
```
